## Witness

Our witness was Mei Mei Chen, a 'Office Lady' who became heavily involved with the respnse to Typhoons after 2015 and Hung Wen Lu a farmer that was affected by the Typhoons and speaks about his experiences.

Mei Mei Chen's organisations [Go Farmer](bit.ly/go-farmer) and [Rong Naida](https://www.facebook.com/groups/197584700968133/) and [Good people club](https://www.facebook.com/%E5%A5%BD%E4%BA%BA%E6%9C%83%E9%A4%A8-321962754494111/) a [video about the Typhoons](https://t.co/LcahuFVOvA).

##Workshop Observations

* 38 people down to around 32 after the first break.
* Unclear some of the time commitments and splitting the two workshops in half.
* Translaters for different language speakers important but lengthens the process.
* Two witnesses brought a great dynamic to the room and they were well prepared.
* The way groups voted was different, one group did a democractic voting system on the challenges and another deciding which was the most important for the farmers to solve and chose that one.
* Very diverse skilll set in this conference/group but all with the singular factors of: Wanting to improve design contribution and Humanitarian focus.

## Learnings

Learnings on how to amend the methodology and/or the workshop framework.

Methodology
1. Similar questions about restriction vs. freedom to design came up from this group. This is a key component for wider involvements from designers in FOSS is the degree to which the FOSS can allow for and encourage design exploration as part of their contribution process.
2. Some attendees considered challenges from a 'scope' pov. What was acheivable in the set workshop time vs. that they wanted to spend more time on. Suggestion for design issues is an estimated amount of time to spend on an issue or at least an indication from the FOSS on how long they consider a design contribution time wise.

Workshop Framework
1. Challenges are now too long. Answering the probing questions from the previous workshop and adding them here as pre-answers is not affective.
2. 5 challenges were too many to cover in the workshop time.
