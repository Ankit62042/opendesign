# Taipei: Open Design Workshop

This file is intended on being a reference for resources for the attendees of the Taipei open Design workshop at Open UP global summit 2019 in Taipei as well as a repository for learnings from the event for the wider Open Design methodology and project.

## Witness

Our witness was Mei Mei Chen, a 'Office Lady' who became heavily involved with the respnse to Typhoons after 2015 and Hung Wen Lu a farmer that was affected by the Typhoons and speaks about his experiences.

Mei Mei Chen's organisations [Go Farmer](bit.ly/go-farmer) and [Rong Naida](https://www.facebook.com/groups/197584700968133/) and [Good people club](https://www.facebook.com/%E5%A5%BD%E4%BA%BA%E6%9C%83%E9%A4%A8-321962754494111/) a [video about the Typhoons](https://t.co/LcahuFVOvA).

## Workshop Observations

* 38 people down to around 32 after the first break.
* Unclear some of the time commitments and splitting the two workshops in half.
* Translaters for different language speakers important but lengthens the process.
* Two witnesses brought a great dynamic to the room and they were well prepared.
* The way groups voted was different, one group did a democractic voting system on the challenges and another deciding which was the most important for the farmers to solve and chose that one.
* Very diverse skilll set in this conference/group but all with the singular factors of: Wanting to improve design contribution and Humanitarian focus.
* The conference had planned workshops back to back and therefore we started 15 minute late due to needing to set up and ran 10 mins over when cleaning up afterwards for the next workshop. Send set-up and take-down times to organisers of conferences pre-event.
* Different countries/cultures use different comms methods as primary comms channel. Slack was ok but folks in Taiwan created Line groups and added workshop facilitator. Pre-research needed into the groups most likely method of comms. Taiwan prefers Line, Facebook and Instagram.
* Conference had a slack group as well as the Open Design slack group so we preferenced the conference slack group out of courtesy. Slack group won't be close soon and will continue for future conferences so no risk of losing contact with attendees.
* Event was offered to non-conference attendees as organisers wanted to maximise attedance for the workshop.
* Event was offered on the conference website but also created facebook events.
* Talk was the day before the workshop which increased the interest in attending the workshop but then we also weren't sure how many people would be able to attend the 1st and 2nd workshop.
* Some confusion when offering an online remote option for those that would find it difficult to travel into Taipei for the second workshop.
* Started 30 minutes late due to the venue elevators being slow and finished 30 minutes late.
* Doing international workshops where people's first/proficient languages aren't that of the project/workshop facilitator requires great translation efforts (which was provided by the conference for this event).
* Translating takes time. Allow for double the amount of time to deliver content/information when translation is present.

## Learnings

Learnings on how to amend the methodology and/or the workshop framework.

### Methodology
1. Similar questions about restriction vs. freedom to design came up from this group. This is a key component for wider involvements from designers in FOSS is the degree to which the FOSS can allow for and encourage design exploration as part of their contribution process.
2. Some attendees considered challenges from a 'scope' pov. What was acheivable in the set workshop time vs. that they wanted to spend more time on. Suggestion for design issues is an estimated amount of time to spend on an issue or at least an indication from the FOSS on how long they consider a design contribution time wise.
3. Comments from developers around when 'design' is complete and ready to be developed.
4. Mentoring and peer-to-peer support needs in-depth investiagtion as well as how the community is built.
5. Because there was a member of the social/content team present.
6. Benefits of having a developer of the OSS software present made clear by some more developer focussed attendees asking about the tech stack of the OSS and how to work with it. In this case Ionic & PWA's.


### Workshop Framework
1. Challenges are now too long. Answering the probing questions from the previous workshop and adding them here as pre-answers is not affective.
2. 5 challenges were too many to cover in the workshop time.
3. Workshop is best delivered with two Open Design leaders and 1 assistant with a content and social focus.
4. Remote activities using Mural and other online tools worked well.
5. Offering online videos and written tutorials on how to complete remote tasks well recieved.
6. There will always be a mismatch between group outputs. Some groups will produce more 'advanced' prototypes or be able to complete more/less work in the time given. The presentation section of the workshop could therefore be standardised so people aren't comparing work.
7. Including step by step upload in the workshop end is key otherwise teams don't upload or put it off. Commitment fear or finalisation fear.
8. Some teams interested in further structured remote sprints.
9. One team finish their prototypes remotely and were able to gain feedback from the workshop leader to iterate in that 2nd workshop session and then re-upload.
10. Short Adobe XD demo was useful for this group as a few had never worked with XD before.
11. Ideal workshop team suspected to be: 2 workshop facilitators/designers, 1 content & socials, 1 volunteer per team (can include 1 facilitators/designers), 1 developer of OSS, 1-2 Witnesses.
