# Open Design workshop framework.

## Teams.
Teams of each 5-6 people. Max 60 attendees for 2 facilitators (30:1 ratio). If volunteers are available, 1 per team plus 3 for runner activities would be best. For a 60 person event, a maximum of 12 volunteers. A minimum of 3-6 volunteers would be sufficient.

Teams ideally constitute of UX, researchers, visual designers, UI designers, graphics designers, Interaction designers & a product manager/coordinator. Teams could double up functions but be careful of workload.

We have some target designers for Open Design [described on page 4 - 7](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10TY67_rHr2WaegGudJyyvQ5xGu1E-ilGFu22dZWdjZo/edit?usp=sharing)of our social media plan.



## Comms.
Teams may organize their own comms channels but there should be a place where we invite attendees to talk if they want to. For conferences, you can use the conference slack and ask to have a channel created. For independent events, you can create and distribute your own. [Sli.do](https://www.sli.do/) might be a place to do so.

Attendees should be kept updated via email that they provided to the conference and/or the event ticket link.

Our Code of Conduct for [community](https://github.com/ushahidi/opendesign/blob/master/codeofconduct-community.md) and [contribution](https://github.com/ushahidi/opendesign/blob/master/codeofconduct-contributing.md)


## Witnesses.
Witnesses are people that have direct experience of the humanitarian challenge that the OSS tool is aiming to solve. In the test case of TenFour, these are people that have witnessed and lived through a crisis like a terrorist attack, flood or a hurricane. These witnesses are invited to talk at the event for around 30 minutes and strongly encouraged to stay for the duration of the event to be accessible to the designers working on the challenges so they can better understand whether what they’re building meets the needs of real people in these scenarios.

## Psychological support.
Because of the nature of some humanitarian OSS projects, there may be a need for a person with skills in counseling/psychology to attend the event as a duty of care to the witnesses and the attendee designers participating in the event. We strongly advise that first hand and second-hand trauma is not undervalued as a potential.


## Breakdown of the day:

### Pre-event work: 
- Pre-email pack - provide links to the TenFour/OSS sticker sheet.
- Pre-email pack - links to the activities like Empathy maps, storyboards, Inspiration boards, etc.
- Pre-email pack running order of the day, logistics, venue, transport, etc.
- Pre-briefing for participants with notification of the focus of the workshop in detail (do not assume everyone  will  read this)
- A way for attendees to talk pre-event. Discord, Slack, Signal group, etc.
- Suggest a tool like Mural to remote collaborate.
- CoC for the event.

### Things to be aware of when doing these kinds of events:

- People that don’t have relevant skills will show up. Eg. Developers
- People will overestimate their skill level with a given tool Eg. Think they are experts when they are ‘intermediate’
- Some people may struggle to form a group or become part of a group. Organizers may be required to ‘place’ people into groups and do this part for people.
- Some people may drop out after break/lunch/an hour etc. Don’t take it personally but also help a group to recover from the loss of a member.
- Some people might not speak English as a 1st language or may be more comfortable with a different language.
- People might swap groups.
- People might have disagreements and part of your role as an organizer/facilitator is to manage these disputes.


### Post-event:
- Post briefing for participants.
- Post-event online meet up to follow up on ideas raised at the event.
- Remind attendees of online space to discuss ideas.
- Follow-up guides on how to continue contributing.



## Template for further workshops

**City name:** Disaster/Relevant scenario type + TenFour/OSS:
**News story:** [Link goes here]

*Example:
**City name:** Bangalore: Kerala flood rescue + TenFour:
**News story:** [gulfnews kerala story](https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/india/for-second-year-in-a-row-kerala-floods-wreak-deadly-havoc-1.1565616937234)

**Witnesses to reach out to:** 
Look for meetup groups, community groups, conference contacts and anyone with experience of the crisis/OSS product focus.
People to invite: Invite attendees to the workshop. Can be via a/the conference or connected communities in the locality.


**People to invite:**
If there are specific people/groups you want to be invovled in the workshop.

*Example: One of the issues that we will focus on in the workshop has chatbot functionality therefore we want to ask people with some chatbot experience to attend.

TenFour/OSS Issue to focus on:

| Title of issue| Description of issue| Issue link  | Action needed                 |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| Issue title   | Issue Description |  [Link/s]  | Any actions on the issue needed? |
| Issue title   | Issue Description |  [Link/s]  | Any actions on the issue needed? |
| Issue title   | Issue Description |  [Link/s]  | Any actions on the issue needed? |

*Example:*

| Title of issue| Description of issue| Issue link  | Action needed                    |
| ------------- |-------------      | ---------- | --------------------------------|
| **SOS button & Status updates**  | In certain situations, my request may be extremely urgent and I may be in immediate danger. In these cases I need ways of communicating information to my org that maintains my safety and communicates the severity of the problem.   |  [Issue 106](https://github.com/ushahidi/tenfour/issues/106) [Issue 66](https://github.com/ushahidi/tenfour/issues/66)   | Merging of the two issues and clearly defining the needs of the feature. |


**Other issues that might be connected & important are:**
- Title + description of issue - [issue link]
- Title + description of issue - [Epic issue link]
      - Title + description of sub-issue [link]
      - Title + description of sub-issue [link]
      - Title + description of sub-issue [link]
      

### Scenarios to look at:
Name of the type of user and their primary concern/objective - Short paragraph on there scenario and set of concerns. What they might be thinking, feeling, doing etc. in the given scenario of TenFour/OSS.

*Example:*
Kerala ex-resident - remote volunteer - Concerns are how to help family & friends from a safe location. Decisions on whether to return to assist and who/what orgs to access to do that safely. Or support remotely. Often spend a lot of time trying to contact family & friends in the area and sometimes coordinating their rescue via official or non-official means.
