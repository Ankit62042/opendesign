## Open Design witnesses.

### Why?
When we challenge designers and technologists to look at how to improve a digital service or product for crisis scenarios, refugee rights, gender equality or sustainability, if we do not purposefully include the people that are affected by that or have experienced this before then we are less able to understand, empathize and design and build an accurate solution to that problem.
We’re reaching out to you to speak at the event as we value your level of experience and expertise in the organization you work or volunteer with. We understand that you are either a survivor or have worked closely with survivors of a tragedy that has taken place and we want to include yours and others' voices in this challenge to solve problems associated with the tragedy. 

### What?
This is a project which aims to create accessible processes for designers to collaborate and contribute to open-source software that does good in the world. Open Design attempts, using Ushahidi’s Open Source crisis communication tool, TenFour as a case study, to achieve this on a global scale.

### Event.
The event is designed so that designers can work collaboratively to contribute to the project in person. This will be done with a special focus on the view of the target subject matter need (e.g. flooding) and yourself as a witness will be able to offer key information and insight into your experience. 
We call these events ‘workshops’ ‘Hackathons’ or ‘design jams’. We’re calling these ‘workshops’ and is an event At these kinds of events, computer programmers/developers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, and others, often including domain experts, collaborate intensively on software projects.
Those responsible for the Open Design delivery should look into organizing the presence of a psychologist/counselor on-site for the full day. If the event is being hosted by conference they will be approached to source and approve the presence of a psychologist and, if applicable access to a conference wellbeing team can be organized.

### Our ask of you.
What we’d like from you is:
A pre-brief video call or in-person meeting before the event. Approx 30-60 minutes.

Going into as much detail as you are comfortable with. This will be delivered to the audience of attendees (primarily designers and technologists interested in the crisis and solutions building).
To stay for the full-day workshop (approx 6 hours) to answer any questions the designers attempting to solve the problems for this tragedy or incident.

If you’d like to be part of the on-going response of these designers and Open Design then we welcome your involvement and support.
