## Design should be open for all.
A project to create accessible processes for designers to collaborate and contribute to humanitarian open source software.

Designers want to tackle big societal problems and improve the human condition. We know this because we’ve seen it. Heard it. Discussed it and felt the need for Open Design across continents.

But when it comes to open source software (OSS), Designers often don’t know what they can do to contribute and how to do it.

Open Design wants to achieve this through co-creation, where the outcome is designed by the community in a collaborative, multidisciplinary way that engages designers from all over the world both online and at live hackathon type events.

# People wanting to take Open Design to their communities should be able to:

**Engagement**
* Foster design to OSS engagement.
* Foster OSS to design engagement.
* Foster the understanding of the role of each other.
* Can use and adapt the Open Design code of conduct and policies. They must follow the CoC.
* Embrace a variety of skills, knowledge, background, demographics, leadership and time commitment.
* A dedicated lead from either the OSS project internally or an appointed contributor with appropriate knowledge base to make decisions on key issues and take learnings and feedback back to the OSS project.

**Types of contributors**
There will be people that have an in-depth understanding of a type of user, geographical area or industry, that will be able to contribute deeper insight than those not knowledgeable on this subject. These people will typically tackle an issue that has not time-bound frame and requires research and investigation to discover a design solution.

There will be people that can offer insight but not time. Therefore, there should be a way in which these people can offer insight that is smaller time bound.

There will be people that can only offer small amounts of time to help and there should be issues able to be completed in under 2 hours.

There will be people that have certain skill competency (self-described) and will only want to assist in that skill competency. There are also people that work across competencies _Example: A design able to contribute both UX skills and UI skills._

There will be people that are not competent in a skill, but want to help on an issue that they can gain mentoring and support from a competent skilled professional.

**Design -** The way a product or service is planned and executed.

**UX -** User experience. The part of a product that focuses on what the experience is. Typically a blend of research, insight and building a ‘journey’ or ‘process’ a user takes through a product or service.
